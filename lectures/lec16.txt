==============================================================

* Recap of BGP from last class, and continuation of BGP. Who needs to
  run BGP? Does a stub organization have to run BGP? In the common
  case, a small organization that buys internet service from an ISP
  just has a static route pointing to the ISP, and gets a small chunk
  of the ISP's IP address space. The ISP takes care of advertising a
  (usually) larger prefix that covers the IP space of several
  customers in one aggregated entry.

* However, many organizations try to have more than one ISP for
  redundancy. This is called multihoming. In this case, the
  organization usually prefers to get its own IP address block, and
  announce it over BGP to several ISPs. Goals of multihoming: load
  balancing across ISPs so that the traffic rate is within the
  contract, to provide redundancy as primary / backup (use second ISP
  only if first is down), use specific ISPs for specific kinds of
  traffic (for example, some ISPs or backbone networks charge less for
  traffic between academic institutions).

* What happens if you use IP prefixes from one ISP's address space,
  while being multihomed?  Suppose your first ISP gives you a prefix
  A/24, and the ISP itself announces a larger A/20 prefix. Now, you
  take your A/24 and announce it via your second ISP also. Now, due to
  longest prefix match, your traffic will always arrive via the second
  ISP which is announcing A/24.

* How do you do load balancing with multihoming? Announce some
  prefixes via one ISP and rest via the other. If a prefix is
  announced via two ISPs, you can load balance on outgoing traffic
  (you can set your forwarding tables to send half the traffic on one
  link, and rest on the other). However, load balancing for inbound
  traffic is hard. That is, you have no control over which link the
  traffic destined to your hosts arrives on. It depends on how other
  routers compute their best paths.

* How do you do configure primary/backup links when you have
  multihoming? Suppose you have two ISPs, P and S, to serve as your
  primary and secondary ISPs. That is, you want traffic to come via S
  only if your link via P is down. If you announce the same prefix via
  P and S, you have no control on which link traffic arrives on. So
  you can do some tricks using BGP. For example, you may announce an
  aggregated prefix (say, one /24) via S, and more specific prefixes
  (say, two /25) via P. So, by default, all traffic will come via the
  P link. Only when the /25 prefixes announced by P are withdrawn due
  to failure of the link via P, then traffic will come via the /24
  through S. Another trick is AS path padding. You can pad your origin
  AS number several times on the path announced via S (e.g., AS1 AS2
  AS3 AS3 AS3), so that it appears as a longer AS path and will not be
  picked by default.

* Aggregating routing table entries. About half the prefixes in
  Internet routing tables are more specific versions of larger
  prefixes. So people argue that a lot of these entries can be
  aggregated to save valuable space, especially in core routing tables
  that tend to be very large. However, note that about half these
  cases of a larger and smaller prefix both appearing are due to
  multihoming. That is, the larger prefix and the smaller prefix have
  different AS paths, indicating that some kind of traffic engineering
  is being done. In such cases, if you aggregate the prefixes, then
  the desired traffic engineering cannot be achieved. BGP has a field
  to indicate if the route can be aggregated or not, which should be
  respected by other BGP routers.

* BGP routing convergence. When BGP routing information changes (e.g.,
  a new prefix or path has come up, or an existing one has gone down),
  BGP updates (announcements or withdrawals) are sent between BGP
  routers. What is the time taken from the time the change happens to
  the time that all routers know of and act according to this new
  information? This time is called the convergence time of a BGP
  update. Empirical studies have shown that this time is several tens
  of seconds. For example, researchers have inserted artificial path
  changes and observed how long it takes for these changes to get
  reflected in publicly available routing tables. This delay is around
  40-80 seconds for new routes coming up, and 80-200 seconds for old
  routes going down. It has also been observed that connectivity to
  the prefix is bad before convergence.

* What explains this high convergence time and issues with BGP? BGP
  undergoes what is called "path exploration" when a routing change
  happens. Since no router has complete knowledge of the topology, a
  few paths have to be tried before the correct routing tables are
  computed. While BGP does not have the routing loops and count to
  infinity problems with distance vector protocols, it does not have
  the quick convergence property of link state protocols either.

* Example: consider 3 ASes 1, 2, 3, all connected to each other and to
  a router R. Ignore the policy aspects of BGP for now. Initially, all
  ASes use their direct path to R, but also learn of the other 1-hop
  paths to R. Now suppose 1 discovers first that its link to R is
  down. Then it sends a withdrawal for its direct route, starts to use
  the route 2->R, and announced this to everyone. Now, this route will
  be come invalid when 2 discovers its link to R is down and withdraws
  the route. But in the meantime, 3 discovers its link to R is down,
  and decides to use the route 3->1->2->R that was announced by 1. So
  messages from everyone about their direct routes (and all other 1
  hop / 2 hop / 3 hop routes) going down have to reach everyone
  else. Only then will the routing table entries converge to the new
  state of no routes to R.

* Note that path exploration will be more as the connectivity of the
  AS graph increases. If the AS graph were a tree, then there would be
  no exploration, as everyone would have only one path between any two
  points. However, once some extra edges are added, path exploration
  starts to happen.

* In addition to the path exploration described above, routers also
  have a certain timer called the minimum route advertisement interval
  (MRAI). When an update to a prefix is sent by a router, it waits for
  MRAI before sending next update. This is to bunch updates related to
  a certain network event instead of flooding the network with
  information. The MRAI adds to the convergence delay, because nodes
  have to wait 30 seconds between successive steps in the path
  exploration.

* Not all updates seen in BGP are due to genuine network topology
  changes either. Sometimes a router gets overloaded and stops
  responding to BGP keepalive messages temporarily. The other BGP peer
  assumes the link is down and sends a withdrawal, followed by an
  announcement soon after. So the route goes between on and off states
  quite frequently. This is called "route flapping". BGP also has a
  mechanism to identify such unstable prefixes. Prefixes that change
  often are awarded a penalty, and updates to such prefixes are
  suppressed for a certain duration once the penalty crosses a
  threshold. This is called route flap dampening.

* Now, BGP changes lead to disruption of network connectivity. During
  path exploration, packets may often go down temporarily incorrect
  paths. Various pathologies can occur. For example, you can have
  transient forwarding loops where packets go around in loops and get
  discarded. Various measurements have observed the correlation
  between temporary bad connectivity to a destination, and the BGP
  updates for that destination.

* End-to-end measurements (usually via traceroutes to measure IP paths
  and delays) are an important tool to understand the quality of
  Internet paths, in contrast to hop-by-hop measurements that do not
  give the complete picture. Several studies have been conducted to
  study the end-to-end quality of Internet paths. Two main metrics -
  the prevalence of a path (measures how often you see a certain IP
  hop path between two nodes) and persistence (how long a given route
  is going to be around). According to a very famous study (see
  references) done a few years ago, typical Internet paths are fairly
  stable and prevalent (that is, a single best route is most widely
  used). However a small fraction of paths see instability every few
  seconds to every few hours.

* Another network layer issue of practical concern - NAT traversal. We
  have seen so far that hosts behind NATs can initiate TCP connections
  to public hosts, but are not reachable from outside. Usually, a NAT
  also has a firewall that stops incoming packets to any internal host
  that it believes do not belong to any existing flow. Suppose two
  hosts A and B are both behind such NATs (+ firewalls), and they want
  to communicate with each other, say, as part of a P2P
  application. Without any external mechanism, such communication
  cannot happen.

* First let us consider NAT traversal for UDP traffic. One method
  followed is to have special servers called STUN (Session Traversal
  Utilities for NATs) servers. Hosts A and B communicate with the STUN
  server initially. This way, the server will know the external IP
  address and port of the hosts. It will then send this information to
  A and B. Now A and B will try to send a packet to the external
  addresses of each other. Suppose A sends a packet first. Now when
  B's packet reaches A, the firewall believes this is reply to A's
  packet and allows this packet through. (Even if A hasn't already
  sent the packet, B can retry periodically, and succeed within a few
  attempts.) This technique is also called NAT hole punching. Such
  elaborate techniques are used by P2P software like Skype to help
  hosts behind NATs to connect with each other.

* Basic premise of the above STUN-based method: the NAT uses the same
  external IP address and port for a given internal IP address and
  port of host A, irrespective of whether it is communicating with the
  STUN server or host B. That is, the NAT only rewrites the source IP
  but not the source port. Only then can the address conveyed by the
  STUN server be used by the other host B to send a packet to host
  A. That is, we require that the external IP and port assigned the
  NAT be the same for a given source IP and port, irrespective of what
  the destination IP and port is. However, some type of NATs called
  symmetric NATs pick a random port number for different connections
  to different destinations from the same internal source IP and
  port. NAT traversal is very hard with such NATs. In such cases,
  users must program the NAT (if allowed by the network administrator)
  to allow traffic on certain ports or allow certain traffic to pass
  through using special protocols that communicate with NATs. For
  example, with the UPnP (universal plug n play) protocol, hosts can
  request a specific public IP and port for their connections and
  convey it to the other end points, so that connections can be
  initiated. However, not all NATs and networks support such
  functionality.

* What about NAT traversal for TCP flows? TCP is a much harder problem
  even with non-symmetric NATs. With TCP, host A generates a SYN
  packet to B, but the reply (SYN ACK) cannot be generated by the
  application layer at B (it is in the control of the OS). So, if both
  end points start a TCP flow, both sides will send SYN and not get
  SYN ACK as a reply because the SYN will be dropped by the other
  NAT. So NAT traversal is a much harder problem. Several techniques
  have been proposed. In one method, the hosts send SYN packets but
  they are sent with a low TTL so that they are dropped before
  reaching a host. The end hosts then use RAW sockets to learn the TCP
  initial sequence numbers and send it to a STUN server. The STUN
  server then spoofs SYNACKs to both hosts with the correct sequence
  number. After this, ACKs go through, and both NATs are fooled into
  believing that the TCP flow has been setup. Such techniques involve
  various network issues (e.g., spoofing may be blocked) and may not
  always succeed.

* A few topics in the network layer that we won't go into much detail:
  broadcast and multicast routing. So far, all layer 3 routing
  algorithms we have seen are for unicast routing, from one host to
  another. Two other modes of communication: broadcast (send a
  messsage to all nodes) or multicast (send a message to a subset of
  hosts). There are algorithms to enable network layer broadcast and
  multicast. Note that network layer multicast (where multicast is
  done at the level of IP routers, by sending only one copy of the
  packet over common IP links) is different from application layer
  multicast (where application nodes build an overlay network and
  perform multicast). Network layer broadcast and multicast are better
  than doing several unicasts or application layer multicast, because
  duplicate traffic at the network layer is suppressed.

* Broadcast routing: given a message, send it all reachable routers in
  some domain. For example, link state announcements (LSAs) must be
  broadcast. One way is for every node to flood a received message on
  all other links (uncontrolled flooding). This can soon result in a
  "broadcast storm" if there are cycles in the network graph - the
  message will keep on getting flooded (e.g., A -> B -> C -> A -> B ->
  C and so on). One way to prevent this is sequence number controlled
  flooding. Messages are given sequene number before broadcast by the
  source. Every node maintains the highest sequence number broadcast
  for every source. A node does not forward a broadcast message if it
  has sent that sequence number already. OSPF uses such an algorithm
  for its LSA flooding.

* Another idea for broadcast routing: reverse path forwarding. When a
  packet receives a broadcast packet from a source, it forwards it on
  all other links ONLY if the link on which the packet arrived is on
  its shortest path to the source. That is, packets are propagated
  only by routers that are on the shortest path. Since no cycles exist
  on the shortest path, broadcast storm will not happen.

* Multicast: a group of routers in the Internet wish to receive
  data. Network layer multicast will prevent duplicate copies of the
  packet over common links, and is better than separate unicasts to
  each node. The Internet has special class D addresses for multicast
  groups - each group receives a unique multicast IP address. To
  subscribe to a multicast group, a host must communicate with the
  first hop IP routers via a protocol called IGMP (Internet Group
  Management Protocol). Then, all IP routers run a multicast routing
  protocol to establish multicast routes. One multicast routing
  protocol is an RPF-like routing protocol, with pruning to supress
  forwarding to nodes that have no multicast subscribed children. Such
  a protocol is suitable when the multicast tree is "dense" with most
  of the IP routers participating. Other protocols exist for when the
  multicast tree is sparse. Note that network layer multicast has not
  taken off in any big way today.

* Note that we mainly studied IP as part of network layer. IP has won
  out over several other competing proposals for the network layer,
  notably ATM (Aynchronous Transfer Mode). ATM was a networking stack
  that was based on virtual circuits and provided reliability and
  other such QoS guarantees at the network layer. In ATM, data was
  sent as 53 byte ATM cells. So variable sized packets had to be
  broken down into cells and the overhead was too high. Before a flow
  started, a virtual cirtuit has to be setup. Every outgoing flow on a
  link was given a virtual cirtuit identifier (VCI) during connection
  setup.  VCIs are unique only over a link (not globally). During
  connection setup, for every incoming flow, routing was done once to
  determine outgoing link, an outgoing VCI was computed, and a mapping
  between incoming VCI and outgoing VCI was stored. So forwarding a
  cell required looking up incoming VCI to determine outgoing VCI and
  outgoing link. This lookup was considered simpler than longest
  prefix match on every packet. However, due to various technical and
  business reasons, ATM didn't really take off as a network layer
  technology. Eventually, IP (and datagrams, as opposed to virtual
  circuits) won over as the layer 3 technology of choice. However, ATM
  and related ideas have uses in Layer 2 (as we will see in the later
  part of the course).
