Basics of Queueing Theory 
(Guest lecture by Prof. Varsha Apte)
====================================

- Computer systems frequently have resources (e.g., link) that needs
  to be shared by several customers. The resource is also called a
  server, and it has a service rate (or service time
  distribution). The customers or users of the system have an arrival
  rate (or inter arrival time distribution). Customers wait in a
  buffer while they wait for service. One of the most basic uses of
  queueing theory is to analyze the behavior of the system in terms of
  number of users in the system, number of users waiting in queue,
  average queueing delay etc.

- Let arrival rate of customers = lambda, service rate = mu. Then 

  Utilization law rho = lambda / mu

- The interarrival time of users and service time distribution are
  both assumed to be exponential or memory-less.

- To compute average waiting time, we model the system as a Markov
  chain, where the state of the system is the number of customers in
  the system. Then, when the system reaches steady state or
  statistical equilibrium, the system moves from state "k" to "k+1"
  with rate lambda, and from K=1 to K with rate mu.

- Let pi_k demote the probability that the system is in state "k". We
  use the steady state condition above, along with the fact that all
  pi_k add up to 1, to derive the values of pi_k for all values of k.

- In particular, pi_0 = probability that the system has 0 users = 1 -
  rho (obvious in hindsight).

- We canculate the expected number of users 

  E[N] = sum over all k (k * pi_k) = rho / (1 - rho)

- Now little's law states that the expected number of users in a
  system is the rate at which users move through the system multiplied
  by the average time the users spend in the system.

  E[N] = lambda * E[R], using which we get 
  E[R] = average waiting time in the system = 1 / (mu - lambda)

- Using the above formulae, we compared FDM (frequency division
  multiplexing), TDM (time division multiplexing), and STDM
  (statistical time division multiplexing that happens with packet
  switching) to understand their relative merits.
