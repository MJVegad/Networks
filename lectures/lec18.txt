=========================================================

* We have seen that switched LANs have to broadcast packets over the
  entire domain ocassionally, leading to scalability issues. One
  solution: virtual LANs. When a switch is configured with VLANs,
  broadcast packets are exchanged only between hosts of a particular
  VLAN, and not across the entire domain. VLANs can be configured as
  port-based (certain ports of a switch are designated to certain
  VLANs), or MAC address-based (certain MAC addresses are mapped to
  certain VLANs).

* Suppose switches S1 and S2 have two VLANs 101 and 102 on their ports
  1--4 and 5--8 respectively. Now, suppose S1 gets a broadcast frame
  on VLAN 101, and must send it to switch S2 in order to connect the
  VLAN 101 hosts on both switches. How is this accomplished? That is,
  when S2 receives a frame from S1, how does it know which ports to
  send it on? One naive way is to connect VLAN 101 ports on both
  switches, VLAN 102 ports on both switches etc. However, this
  requires N ports used up on each switch to connect N VLANs. Instead,
  the switches can be connected using only one port on each switch,
  and this link can carry traffic of all VLANs. In this case, we need
  to tag frames with the VLAN ID, so that the other switch knows what
  to do with this frame. This is called VLAN trunking. With VLAN
  trunking, two switches are only connected using one port at each
  switch, and traffic on this link is tagged with VLAN ID between the
  switches using a special frame header.

* Some common link layers used in LANs: Ethernet is the most popular,
  PPP for point-to-point links, ocassionally ATM. The physical layer
  is copper or fiber (for faster ethernets). Link layers like
  TokenRing are rarely used these days.

* What about residential networks? DSL and other technologies
  piggyback data over existing telephone or cable TV lines. Recently,
  Fiber To The Home (FTTH) initiatives provide high speed fiber
  connectivity to homes to leveraging new low cost fiber
  equipment. Ethernet is also being considered as a "first mile"
  access technology these days.
 
* WAN links: some common examples are PPP over SONET (long distance
  fiber links), frame relay over leased T1 lines (circuit switched
  over telephone lines), ATM. A new idea these days is to use Ethernet
  over WAN links as well, termed Metro Ethernet. The Ethernet
  technology is being improved to scale well over long links.

* ATM and virtual cirtuit switching. When it was first developed, ATM
  was considered a serious competetitor to packet switched IP
  networks. ATM is based on the concept of virtual circuit
  switching. When A wants to start a flow to destination D, it sends a
  setup message that is routed along the correct path to D (say, via
  ATM switches B and C). After the virtual circuit is setup is
  complete, state is established along the path on how to forward data
  of this circuit. Every subsequent packet only carries a virtual
  circuit identifier (VCI) and intermediate switches will forward data
  using this VCI. ATM uses fixed length 53 bute frames called "cells".

* Note that a VCI need not have global scope (i.e., unique across the
  network). VCI in ATM only has "link local" scope. That is, flows
  over a given link need to have unique VCIs. So, when a node sends a
  cell on a link for the first time, it picks a VCI that is not in use
  at that link. The receiving switch notes the incoming VCI, picks an
  outgoing link and VCI again. So, switches in ATM maintain a table
  mapping incoming link and incoming VCI to outgoing links and
  outgoing VCI. Whenever a cell arrives on the link, an ATM switch
  looks up the entry corresponding to the incoming link and VCI, finds
  out the outgoing link for that cell, and rewrites the outgoing VCI
  number.

* ATM was considered to be better than datagram based IP networks
  because of fixed length VCI and cells, leading to bounded latencies,
  and the benefit of setting up circuits to provide guarantees
  services. However, the best effort Internet performed reasonably,
  and ATM lost out to IP. 

* MPLS (multi protocol label switching) is a more recent technology
  that borrows some aspects from ATM. MPLS is not based on circuit
  switching, and is designed to work with packet switching and IP
  datagrams. However, it wishes to modify the forwarding logic of IP
  datagrams. At some point, it was thought that IP lookup algorithms
  based on longest prefix match would be too slow to forward data on
  high speed links, and that a fixed label lookup was needed. This was
  the initial motivation for MPLS. 

* MPLS works similar to ATM in the forwarding path. There is no
  connection setup. When an IP datagram arrives into an MPLS enabled
  network, the first MPLS edge router introduces a label on the
  packet. Sunsequent MPLS routers perform label switching, much like
  ATM cells. That is, all MPLS routers along the path maintain mapping
  from incoming label and link to outgoing link and label, and swap
  labels on packets. So MPLS routers are also called label switching
  routers (LSRs). Note that ATM switches can be easily reused to be
  LSRs.

* Where is MPLS label added? MPLS has a 20 bit label in a 4 byte
  header. This header is usually placed between IP and layer 2
  headers, so MPLS is considered layer 2.5.

* While the initial motivation for MPLS wasn't strong (IP lookup
  algorithms became fast enough), MPLS has found other uses. Some of
  these are listed below.

- Traffic engineering. MPLS can used to "pin" different IP flows to
  the same destination to different label switched paths (LSPs), to
  distribute load evenly and perform traffic engineering in ISP
  backbone networks.

- MPLS can be used for fast reroute, to compute alternate paths in
  case of link failures before STP recovers and finds an alternate
  path.

- MPLS can be used to build Layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs. The concept is
  similar to IP-in-IP tunneling. That is, to connect two private
  networks, the IP datagram in the private space is encapsulated with
  an MPLS header and tunneled to the other end point, after which the
  MPLS header is removed. However, MPLS based VPNs are more efficient
  because the MPLS header (4 bytes) is smaller than the IP header
  overhead (20 bytes) of IP-in-IP tunneling.

- In general, MPLS has found many uses because the labels can be
  refurbished to mean different things and serve different purposes.

* How are MPLS labels distributed? It depends on the purpose of using
  MPLS. For simple destination based forwarding, labels can be
  distributed with prefixes as part of routing protocols. For traffic
  engineering, a reservation protocol like RSVP along with a shortest
  path algorithm based on bandwidth constraints can be used to compute
  paths and fix labels. For VPN services, labels are distributed with
  BGP. So distribution of labels requires some routing protocol, much
  like normal IP.
